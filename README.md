# FamilyMapClient

This is the Android client that goes along with the FamilyMapServer repo. This was coded in Java for an assignment in CS 240 at BYU. Its features include registering a user, login in a user, viewing that user's genealogy (fabricated), the ancestors' events on a google map, details on the ancestors, various settings to hide/show types of events or relations between people, and the ability to log out.

I learned a lot of things from this assignment including various design patterns such as the singleton pattern and the adapter pattern, asynchronous coding in Android Studio using Java, receiving and sending data via Java's HTTPClient, and various coding principles.

This assignment was completed in Aug, 2022.
